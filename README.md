# Automation Learning Repository

Welcome to the Automation Learning Repository! This repository is created to facilitate learning automation techniques using various tools and frameworks such as Rest Assured, Maven, TestNG, Selenium, Git, and Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

## Overview

This repository contains examples and exercises to help you learn and practice automation testing using industry-standard tools and methodologies. You'll find detailed instructions, code samples, and explanations to guide you through the learning process.

## Tools and Frameworks

### 1. Rest Assured

Rest Assured is a Java library that simplifies testing of RESTful web services. It provides a fluent interface for writing API tests and validating responses.

### 2. Maven

Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the build process, manages dependencies, and facilitates project management.

### 3. TestNG

TestNG is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit but introduces some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use. It provides annotations to define test methods, grouping, parameterization, and parallel execution.

### 4. Selenium

Selenium is a popular open-source tool for automating web browsers. It allows you to interact with web elements, simulate user actions, and perform functional testing of web applications.

### 5. Git

Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaboration and tracking of changes in code. It is essential for managing project versions, branching, and merging code changes.

### 6. Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It automates the build, test, and deployment phases of software development.
